# Do's
#### Patterns & methodologies...

- BEM
    - Modularity
    - Reusability
    - Structure
- Failure-first design
    - Things will go wrong. Plan accordingly.
- Test everything.
- Documentation / examples as first class
- Mobile-first where appropriate (which is most of the time).
- Responsive design.
- Prefer enforced immutability.
- Prefer small libraries
- Prefer promises to callbacks
- Prefer a functional style
- Use Semver
- Inversion of control (push all the stuff into a component that you'll need)
- Packages (style, behaviour, markup, tests all together)
- Uni-directional data flow (two-way bindings make us sad)
- Universal / isomorphic UIs where justified
