# Re-use / Efficiency gains across UIs

#### HUI
- Things it does well.
    - Consistency
    - Efficiency
- Things it does badly (including painful mistakes we encountered earlier..)
    - Breaking changes
    - Introducing bugs across teams
    - The cost of building for the library when you want to add a small component feels extreme
    - Maintaining multiple versions to support each UI's lifecycle is expensive

#### Other topics for reuse / sharing
- EDH-Widgets
- Design concepts! Cheapest to share, biggest consistency win.
- UX solutions
    - how we tested it, what we learned etc.
- Browser targets
