# Goals

#### General
* **Progressive**
    * Where possible the codebase should use the latest syntax, libraries, and methodologies to ensure it advances and does not stagnate
* **Tested**
    * Comprehensive test suit. UX tested
* **Open source**
    * Where possible open source the project to maximise it's potential
* **Small**
    * Codebase should be specific to a particular function and requirement.
    * A small service or library to deliver a particular need.
    * Distributed assets on a client should be efficient. It should only include what you need
* **Documented**
    * Detailed documentation is required

#### Design
* **Familiar**
    * Naturally and instinctively understood and comprehended
* **Responsive**
    * Fast and provide feedback.
    * Never leave the user wondering what's happening
* **Consistent**
    * Be predictable and learnable
* **Attractive**
    * Aesthetics are as important as user experience
* **Concise**
    * Give clear direction in the smallest way possible and no more or less
* **Efficient**
    * Drive users to goals in the shortest number of steps
* **Forgiving**
    * Confirm Destructive actions, provide suggestions and help on failure
* **Contextual**
    * Offer the most likely action at the optimal time
* **Emblematic**
    * A UI should reflect the brand persona clearly

#### Development
* **Modular**
    * UI should be broken into small composable components.
    * Components should be self contained and not have dependencies on other components
* **Structured**
    * Clear maintainable structure with a low barrier to entry for development
* **Fluid**
    * Promote rapid evolution not big bang changes
    * Codebase, libraries, technology and UI design
* **Stateful**
    * Ownership and flow of view state should be apparent
* **Tested**
    * Unit testable, User experience validation
* **Scalable**
    * A UI library should be usable for large scale applications or small page decoration
* **Sharable**
    * A UI library should be able to integrate into a codebase in a variety of ways with minimal conflict with exiting technology stacks. It should fit soundly with the larger UI stack as much as possible
* **Empowering**
    * A UI library should empower development and developers to create better applications * never throttle or stifle innovation, usability or code quality
